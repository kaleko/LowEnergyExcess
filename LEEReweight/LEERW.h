 *
 * \brief This class gets handed a neutrino interaction (mctruth object) and computes a weight.
 *  The weight takes into account the energy and angle of the outgoing electron in the interaction
 *  as well as cross section scalings and flux scalings from MiniBooNE to MicroBooNE.
 *  This weight will sculpt the neutrino energy spectrum to a shape that matches the MB scaled excess prediction.
 *  Knowing how many excess events are expected in MicroBooNE (from the scaling prediction), the weight is
 *  multiplied such that the final integral of the energy spectrum is what is expected.
 *  The idea is the user can generate nue interactions, apply some sort of filter to select one that
 *  pass MiniBooNE event selection cuts (one subevent, etc)
 *  then hand the neutrino interaction to this package to get a weight. Looping over events and
 *  histogramming them with this weight will produce a simulated low energy excess in MicroBooNE.
 *  (of course assuming the excess comes from an excess of nue interactions)
 *
 *  This takes a while to initialize. Its initialization loops over ALL of the events and stores the weight
 *  for each event. This is necessary because for absolute normalization, one needs to know the sum of all weights
 *  a priori.
